    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
    <p>In my spare time I consume media; I read what people think about it and sometimes I write what I think about it. This is where you'll find all my writing, collections, thoughts, notes. I'm currently working as a site reliability engineer.</p>
    <p>Other interests include game dev, electronic music production, bass guitar, motion graphics, video editing, pixel art, 3D graphics, and like, a lot more. My interests never end...
    <p>If you're unsure of where to start, may I suggest gandering at one of my <a href="/writing/lists">lists</a>? Or maybe you'd prefer checking out my <a href="/writing/projects">projects</a>?
